# Multiple Animals Per Invoice - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Updated the invoice system to support multiple animals per invoice while maintaining a single client requirement.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **Invoice Model** (`backend/src/models/Invoice.js`)

   - Changed `animal` field to `animals` array of ObjectIds
   - Updated validation to require at least one animal

2. **Invoice Routes** (`backend/src/routes/invoiceRoutes.js`)

   - Updated all `.populate("animal")` calls to `.populate("animals")`
   - Modified queries that filtered by `animal` to use `animals`

3. **Migration Script** (`scripts/migrate-invoice-animals.js`)
   - Created migration script to convert existing invoices
   - Converts single `animal` field to `animals` array
   - Can be run in production to migrate existing data

### Frontend Changes

1. **TypeScript Models** (`src/types/models.ts`)

   - Updated `Invoice` interface: `animalId: string` → `animalIds: string[]`

2. **InvoicesPage** (`src/pages/Invoices/InvoicesPage.tsx`)

   - Updated `ExtendedInvoice` and `ApiInvoice` interfaces for multiple animals
   - Modified `transformInvoiceData` function to handle `animalIds` array
   - Updated DataGrid column to display multiple animal names
   - Enhanced search functionality to search across all animals
   - Updated detail dialog to show all animals for an invoice

3. **InvoiceForm** (`src/pages/Invoices/InvoiceForm.tsx`)
   - Updated form data interface: `animalId: string` → `animalIds: string[]`
   - Changed validation schema to require array of animal IDs
   - Updated animal selection to use multi-select Autocomplete
   - Modified form submission to send `animals` array instead of single `animal`
   - Updated handlers to manage array of selected animals

## Key Features

- **Multi-Select Animal Field**: Users can now select multiple animals for a single invoice
- **Backward Compatibility**: Migration script ensures existing invoices work seamlessly
- **Enhanced UI**:
  - Animal names are displayed as comma-separated list in the invoice grid
  - Detail view shows all animals associated with an invoice
  - Form validation ensures at least one animal is selected

## Migration Instructions

### For Development

Run the migration script locally:

```bash
cd backend
node ../scripts/migrate-invoice-animals.js
```

### For Production (Render)

1. Use Render Shell to access your backend service
2. Copy the migration script to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cp ../scripts/migrate-invoice-animals.js ./migrate-invoice-animals.js
   ```
3. Run the migration:
   ```bash
   node migrate-invoice-animals.js
   ```

## Testing

- Create new invoices with multiple animals
- Edit existing invoices (animals field should be read-only as before)
- Verify search functionality works across all animal names
- Check that invoice details show all associated animals

## Notes

- The client field remains singular - only one client per invoice
- Animals must belong to the selected client/organization
- Existing invoice creation permissions and validation remain unchanged
- PDF generation and printing functionality will need separate updates to handle multiple animals (not included in this update)
